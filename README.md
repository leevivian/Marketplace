# Marketplace

An E-commerce Web Application implemented with the LAMP Stack (Linux, Apache HTTP Server, MySQL, PHP 7) to host the website.

## Description

Our product is named “SFSU Marketplace”. We are an online, buy/sell website designed specifically for San Francisco State University students. We offer a quick, easy, and convenient way for students to sell their old textbooks, furniture, appliances, etc. to other students.

Anyone who visits this site is able to browse through all of our listings online, posted by SFSU students.

These listings can be accessed through an easy-to-use search bar. Additionally, you are able to narrow searches by categories (such as furniture, books, or appliances) or item condition (new, like new, used).

After registering an account with us by providing an SFSU email address, users are then able to message other users through our website to connect with different buyers and sellers.

A registered user is able to post their listings to our website, making it visible to anyone. Listings can contain a picture of the product you are selling, a quick description, title, relevant category, and a price you determine. SFSU Marketplace does not take any cut from your sales and charges nothing to host your listings. In addition to that, SFSU Marketplace makes easy suggestions of on-campus locations to meet between users and exchange goods.
